## General Information
- It's regrettable in our today's world(driven by Technology) that many organizations like schools, and companies especially in West African countries still uses the manual way of taking daily attendance: The secretary creates a blank paper sheet where every staff needs to start writing their names and the time they arrive.
This method is very cumbersome, time-wasting and not efficient for any further evaluation. 
- The purpose of this project is to transform the old/manual way of taking attendance into a digital one with a more elegant and efficient features  

## Technologies Used
- [Firebase firestore for backend](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)
- [MVVM architecture + Repository pattern](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-training-repository-pattern#0)
- [Dagger-Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android)
- [Android Jetpack Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation)
- and more



## Features
- The admin can create attendance for each day(similar to creating a blank sheet) and the staff would just go and start sending in their names. No need for writing the time the attendance was taking because it would be captured immediately.
- The admin can see a list of the attendance for each day from the admin screen.

## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_


## Room for Improvement
A more elegant feature to be included: 

- To make the attendance location-based. Staff would only be able to take attendance if they are within the specified location.
- A facial scan of each staff to prevent impersonation.
- The admin should be able to export the list of each day's attendance into excel or other formats for further evaluation.
- The Staff should be able to install the application on their devices. Authentication and authorization are required.


## Acknowledgements
- Many thanks to one of my 10 year old student, Farouk Ndakpayi. He came up with this idea for his school and I loved it. So, we decided to create the app together within just few days. 
I did the coding and he was suggesting what and what to do/include. He will be like, 'Sir, let's include this and that. How about we do it this way or that way'.
